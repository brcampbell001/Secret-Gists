Bob is a 58 year old independent CPA. He primarily services medium-income individuals and local businesses in his town of 10,000. Bob shares office space with two others, both also independent CPAs. He describes his relationship with them as cordial, but not quite friendly. They are in competition with one another after all.
These days, Bob does most of his work by computer. He regularly uses email, an online file sharing website, and desktop tax software in his work. Although he has had to learn many new things as his work has changed, Bob has gained a reasonable understanding of the technology he uses. The records for each of his clients are encrypted using a different password. He also used different passwords for each online service. These passwords are kept in a notebook, which Bob diligently keeps locked in his file cabinet when not in use.

Yolanda, 17, is the most popular girl in her school. Her Insta is perfectly curated, her Snaps are da bomb, and her Facebook account exists so she can talk to her grandma every other Sunday.
She is on her phone constantly. Typing in pin numbers or doing those silly patterns takes too much time, and she always has her phone in hand anyway, so what’s the point in locking it? Yolanda also keeps all of her accounts logged in at all times so she can make sure she likes all of William’s posts before Jennifer gets to them.
Yolanda gets along well with most of classmates, except Jennifer, but there are always haters who want to take people down.
